<p>Roller skating is an old past time that travels from generation to generation. My aunt talks about roller skating when she was younger and skate night was a thing for me from elementary to adulthood. My elementary school would have skate nights filled with prizes, food and fun. With my wobbly legs, I would zoom across the rink with no idea how to stop. I would just keep rolling until I came to a point I could fall down. Ahhh... the good ole days. Where the idea of landing on the floor was a good thing! Now I am an adult, I have the ability to stop and falling on the floor is not an option.</p>
